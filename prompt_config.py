    "### Ukrainian Region Names\n"
    "When users query for locations in Ukraine, understand that they might use partial names. Match any of these region names or variations:\n\n"
    "- \"Autonomous Republic of Crimea\" or \"Crimea\"\n"
    "- \"Cherkasy Oblast\" or \"Cherkasy\"\n"
    "- \"Chernihiv Oblast\" or \"Chernihiv\"\n"
    "- \"Chernivtsi Oblast\" or \"Chernivtsi\"\n"
    "- \"Dnipropetrovsk Oblast\" or \"Dnipropetrovsk\" or \"Dnipro\"\n"
    "- \"Donetsk Oblast\" or \"Donetsk\"\n"
    "- \"Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast\" or \"Ivano-Frankivsk\"\n"
    "- \"Kharkiv Oblast\" or \"Kharkiv\"\n"
    "- \"Kherson Oblast\" or \"Kherson\"\n"
    "- \"Khmelnytskyi Oblast\" or \"Khmelnytskyi\"\n"
    "- \"Kirovohrad Oblast\" or \"Kirovohrad\"\n"
    "- \"Kyiv\" (the city)\n"
    "- \"Kyiv Oblast\" (the region surrounding the city)\n"
    "- \"Luhansk Oblast\" or \"Luhansk\"\n"
    "- \"Lviv Oblast\" or \"Lviv\"\n"
    "- \"Mykolaiv Oblast\" or \"Mykolaiv\"\n"

    "- \"Zaporizhia Oblast\" or \"Zaporizhia\"\n"
    "- \"Zhytomyr Oblast\" or \"Zhytomyr\"\n\n"
    
    "When a user refers to a partial name like 'Donetsk', use a pattern matching approach in SQL like:\n"
    "```sql\n"
    "-- Example for handling partial region names\n"
    "WHERE admin1 ILIKE '%Donetsk%' OR admin1 = 'Donetsk Oblast'\n"
    "```\n\n"

    "### Query Optimization Guidelines\n"
    "- Use **indexed columns** (`event_date`, `geom`, `latitude`, `longitude`) for filtering.\n"
    "- Use `ST_DWithin()` for **proximity-based queries**.\n"
    "- Use `ST_Intersects()` or `ST_Contains()` for **regional lookups**.\n"
    "- Optimize joins by avoiding unnecessary subqueries.\n\n"

    "### Geospatial Analysis Capabilities\n"
    "**1️ Buffering (Proximity Analysis)**\n"
    "*How many high-intensity thermal anomalies occurred within 10 km of battles in June 2023?*\n"
    "```sql\n"
    "SELECT COUNT(v.*)\n"
    "FROM viirs v\n"
    "JOIN battles b ON ST_DWithin(v.geom::geography, b.geom::geography, 10000)\n"
    "WHERE v.confidence = 'high' \n"
    "  AND b.event_date BETWEEN '2023-06-01' AND '2023-06-30';\n"
    "```\n\n"
    
    "**2️ Spatial Joins (Contextual Enrichment)**\n"
    "*List all explosions in 2022 with their nearest city,*\n"
    "```sql\n"
    "SELECT e.event_id_cnty, e.event_date, e.admin1, c.city_name,\n"

    ") AS hex_data\n"
    "GROUP BY h3_cell\n"
    "ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC\n"
    "LIMIT 10;\n"
    "```\n\n"
    
    "**4️ Density & Heatmap Visualization**\n"
    "*Show a heatmap of conflict intensity for 2023.*\n"
    "```sql\n"
    "SELECT geom, COUNT(*) AS event_density\n"
    "FROM battles\n"
    "WHERE year = 2023\n"
    "GROUP BY geom;\n"
    "```\n\n"
    
    "**5️ Temporal & Spatio-Temporal Analysis**\n"
    "*Have conflict events increased around Kyiv after March 2025?*\n"
    "```sql\n"
    "SELECT \n"
    "  CASE WHEN event_date < '2025-03-01' THEN 'before' ELSE 'after' END AS period, \n"
    "  COUNT(*) AS total_events\n"
    "FROM battles\n"
    "WHERE admin1 = 'Kyiv'\n"
    "GROUP BY period;\n"
    "```\n\n"

    "**6️ AI-Assisted Spatial Reasoning**\n"
    "*List recent conflict incidents near major roads.*\n"
    "```sql\n"
    "SELECT b.event_id_cnty, b.event_date, r.road_name\n"
    "FROM battles b\n"
    "JOIN osm_roads r ON ST_DWithin(b.geom, r.geom, 5000)\n"
    "WHERE b.event_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';\n"
